Data Quality Issues:
Missing Values: If any columns have a significant number of missing values, it indicates data incompleteness and potential issues with data collection or recording.

Duplicates: If there are duplicates in the data, it suggests data duplication or data entry errors.

Outliers: By examining summary statistics, we can identify outliers in numerical columns. These could be indications of data entry errors, measurement errors, or other anomalies.

Unexpected or Invalid Values: By inspecting the unique values and their frequencies in categorical columns, we can identify unexpected or invalid values that might indicate data quality issues, such as data entry errors or inconsistencies.

Inconsistent Relationship: If there are discrepancies or inconsistencies between the values in different columns that are expected to be related, it may indicate data integrity issues or inconsistencies in recording.
